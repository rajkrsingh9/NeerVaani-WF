                <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p class="p1">Water scarcity is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Agriculture, which is
                    the backbone
                    of most economies, relies heavily on water for irrigation. With the growing pressure on water
                    resources, it becomes vital to understand how much water is available and how efficiently it is
                    being used.</p>
                <p>In many regions, surface and groundwater supplies are shrinking due to overuse, pollution, and
                    climate change. This puts immense strain on food production and overall water sustainability.
                    Without precise knowledge of water availability and consumption patterns, effective management
                    becomes impossible.</p>

                <h3>Every Drop Counts: Tackling Water Scarcity for a Sustainable Future</h3>
                <p>Water scarcity is an escalating issue impacting communities, industries, and ecosystems worldwide.
                    Agriculture, the largest consumer of freshwater, is at the heart of this challenge. Let’s delve into
                    the key problems and their impacts.</p>
                <h3>Challenges and Impact on Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Overuse of groundwater and surface water threatens sustainability, worsened by a lack of regional
                    data and awareness about water footprints. This leads to droughts, crop failures, and inefficient
                    farming practices, reducing productivity and straining resources further.</p>
